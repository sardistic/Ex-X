# Un-X Twitter Chrome Extension

**Un-X Twitter** is a Chrome extension that reverts the new "X" branding on Twitter back to its classic look. This extension replaces the new "X" Twitter logo and favicon with the traditional Twitter bird logo and favicon, providing a more familiar and less disruptive user experience for those who prefer the traditional Twitter design.

## Features

- **Twitter Logo Replacement:** The extension swaps out the new "X" logo on Twitter's webpage with the classic Twitter bird logo. This change is applied across all pages within the Twitter domain, restoring the nostalgic feel of the original Twitter experience.

- **Favicon Replacement:** Un-X Twitter also replaces the new "X" favicon displayed in the browser tab with the classic Twitter favicon, ensuring a consistent user experience across all visual touchpoints with Twitter.

## Usage

1. **Download the Extension:** You can download the extension from the repository and load it into your Chrome browser as an unpacked extension.

2. **Navigate to Twitter:** After you've loaded the extension, simply navigate to Twitter's website. The extension works quietly in the background to replace the logo and favicon with the classic Twitter versions, requiring no additional input from the user.

## Why Un-X Twitter?

Social media branding changes can sometimes feel jarring or unnecessary, especially for long-term users who have grown accustomed to the original branding. Un-X Twitter is perfect for those who aren't quite ready to move on to Twitter's new "X" branding, and who'd like a touch of nostalgia as they scroll through their Twitter feed. 

This extension does not collect or store any personal data, adheres to Chrome's permissions policy, and is fully open source, ensuring a safe and transparent user experience.
